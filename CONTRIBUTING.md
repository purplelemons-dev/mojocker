If you have an idea for anything, or even see an unresolved [issue](https://github.com/purplelemons-dev/mojocker/issues), don't hesitate to show off your coding skills!
I keep tabs on all my repositories so I'll happily review your code and merge it.

Some things I am currently looking for are:
* [Resolving vulnerabilities](https://github.com/purplelemons-dev/mojocker/labels/vulnerability).
* Decreasing image size.
* Creating a better developer experience.
